# Repair USB drive split into multiple partitions

<time dateTime="2024-01">Jan 2024</time>

When you plug in a USB drive, you expect to see a single drive letter in Windows File Explorer. However, after messing with some partitioning tools or programs like <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/" target="_blank">balenaEtcher</a>, you might find that your USB drive is now showing as multiple partitions.

We will use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskpart" target="_blank">diskpart</a> utility to fix this issue. It's a command-line disk partitioning tool that comes built-in with Windows.

Before proceeding, make sure to **back up any important data** on the USB drive as this process will **erase** all existing partitions.

1. Press **Win + X** and select **Command Prompt (Admin)** or **Terminal (Admin)** depending on your Windows version, to open an elevated Command Prompt window.
2. Type `diskpart` and press Enter to run the diskpart utility.
3. Run `list disk` to display a list of all disks connected to your computer.
4. Identify the disk number of your USB drive (it's usually the smallest capacity disk) and run `select disk X` (replace X with the disk number).
5. Run `clean` to remove all partitions and volumes from the USB drive.
6. Create a new partition by running `create partition primary`.
7. Run `select partition 1` to select the newly created partition.
8. Format the partition by running `format quick` to prepare it for use.

After following these steps, your USB drive should now appear as a single partition in Windows File Explorer. If you encounter any issues or the problem persists, you may need to use third-party partitioning tools to fix the USB drive.
