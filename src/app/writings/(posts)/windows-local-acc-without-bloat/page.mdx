<h1>Create a local account on Windows without bloatware</h1>

<hr />

Windows 10/11 comes with a lot of bloatware by default and enforces you to use a Microsoft account when you first set up your computer. This is not ideal for privacy reasons and you might want to use a local account instead.

When you are installing your Windows version, you will be asked to choose your time and currency format. You will have to select **"English (World)"** or **"English (Europe)"**. By doing that, Microsoft will not be able to guess your country and won't give you country-specific bloatware.

After the setup is complete, you will have to configure your OOBE (Out of Box Experience) settings.

It will take a bit to load because it tries to guess your location but since we chose a generic time and currency format, it won't be able to guess it. It will output an error and it's totally fine.

Once it's finished loading and you have access to your keyboard, you will have to press **Shift + F10** to open the command prompt. Type `OOBE\BYPASSNRO` and press Enter.

Your computer will restart and you will be able to create a local account without bloatware by choosing **"I don't have internet"** when you are asked to connect to a network.

Proceed with the setup and you will have a local Windows account without bloatware.

Don't forget to change your time and currency format back to your country's format if you want to use the Microsoft Store or other Microsoft services.
