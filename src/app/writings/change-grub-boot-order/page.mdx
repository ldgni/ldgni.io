# Change GRUB boot order

If you have a dual-boot (or multi-boot) setup, you might want to change the default boot option in GRUB so that your preferred operating system boots automatically.

For my specific case, I have a dual-boot setup with Ubuntu and Windows, and I want Windows to be the default boot option in GRUB.

First of all, let's make a backup of the GRUB configuration file:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.bak
```

Now, open the GRUB configuration file in a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Find the line that starts with **GRUB_DEFAULT=** and change the value to the index of the OS you want to be the default boot option. The index starts at 0, so the first OS in the list is 0, the second is 1, and so on.

If you don't know the index of the OS you want to set as the default, you can find it by simply rebooting your system and checking the GRUB menu. Start counting from 0, and you'll find the index of your desired OS.

Here I wish to set Windows as the default boot option, so I'm changing the value to 2 in my case:

```bash
GRUB_DEFAULT=2
```

**Save the changes** and exit the text editor.

Finally, update the GRUB configuration by running:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

Now, when you restart your system, the OS you selected in the GRUB configuration file should be the default boot option.
